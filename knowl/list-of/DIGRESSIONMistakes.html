<div class="para">Sadly, mistakes are too often seen as a source of embarrassment. Too many students will berate themselves every time they make a mistake. Don’t do that. It is pointless and counter-productive. All it will do is destroy your self confidence. Don’t do it. Learning Calculus can be hard, but you would not have made it this far if you couldn’t do it.<div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#DIGRESSIONMistakes-4" title="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph" aria-label="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph">🔗</a></div>

<div class="para">By definition, mistakes are wrong. A mistake is always obvious after you recognize it as a mistake.  Everyone makes mistakes in the course of solving a problem. The process of making mistakes, recognizing them as mistakes, and figuring out why they are mistakes is called learning. The very smartest people, for example <a class="external" href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Newton/" target="_blank">Isaac Newton</a>, <a class="external" href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Leibniz/" target="_blank">Gottfried Leibniz</a>, <a class="external" href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Galileo/" target="_blank">Galileo</a>, <a class="external" href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Fermat/" target="_blank">Pierre Fermat</a>, <a class="external" href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/madame-curies-passion-74183598/" target="_blank">Marie Curie</a>, <a class="external" href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Noether_Emmy/" target="_blank">Emmy Nöther</a>, <a class="external" href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Einstein/" target="_blank">Albert Einstein</a>, or <a class="external" href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Feynman/" target="_blank">Richard Feynman</a>, made lots of mistakes. Making mistakes is how they got to be smart.<div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#DIGRESSIONMistakes-5" title="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph" aria-label="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph">🔗</a></div>

<div class="para">Isaac Newton was once asked how he had been able to solve problems that no one before him had solved. His reply: “By thinking, and thinking, and thinking about them.” Of course, when he described his solutions he left out all of the errors like anyone would do, because, who cares about those? Making mistakes doesn’t typically get the attention it deserves.   An expert is someone who has made every possible mistake. This is why your teacher, an expert, will seldom err. And will be embarrassed when they do.<div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#DIGRESSIONMistakes-6" title="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph" aria-label="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph">🔗</a></div>
</div>
<div class="para">Each mistake you make reflects the level of your current understanding of the problem. Each mistake you make takes you a little closer to expertise.  Embrace your mistakes and make lots of them!  They are proof that you are making progress.  But make no mistake (gasp!) about it,  making and embracing a mistake is just the first step. You also have to figure out what went wrong.<div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#DIGRESSIONMistakes-7" title="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph" aria-label="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph">🔗</a></div>
