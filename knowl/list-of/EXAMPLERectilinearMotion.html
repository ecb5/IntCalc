<div class="para"> The idea of representing velocities with arrows is quite a powerful and common technique for representing non-linear motion. Roberval used this technique to find the tangent lines of the conic sections (as we will soon see) as well as more general curves. Since Roberval’s time this idea has been developed considerably beyond what Roberval did. In fact we are skirting the edge of some very deep ideas here. In modern terms these arrows would be called <dfn class="terminology">vectors</dfn>. Using this terminology <dfn class="terminology">Vector Addition</dfn> is then done by the <dfn class="terminology">Parallelogram Rule</dfn>, which is essentially what we did in <a href="SECTIONroberv-conic-sect.html#FIGUREVectorAddition" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/FIGUREVectorAddition.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 3.6.1.3">Figure 3.6.1.3</a>: Form the parallelogram and find its diagonal.  The full force of vector analysis was not available to Roberval, and we won’t need it either so we will not take you any further down this path but we encourage you visualize velocities, and any other directed quantity, as composed of horizontal and vertical components whenever you can. You will see this representation in more detail later in your education and it will help if you have already begun thinking in these terms.<div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#EXAMPLERectilinearMotion-7" title="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph" aria-label="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph">🔗</a></div>
