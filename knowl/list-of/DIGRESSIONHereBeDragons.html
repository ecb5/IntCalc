<div class="para">Sure we can. Time itself is “changing in time”, isn’t it?

Loosely speaking (and mixing the Newtonian and Leibnizian viewpoints a bit), an increment of time now has the same magnitude as an increment of time later, has the same magnitude as an increment of time in the past. That is, every increment of <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> is the same size.  If we let <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> represent elapsed time then this means that the infinitesimal increment <span class="process-math">\(\dx{t}\)</span> is constant, so the fluxion of <span class="process-math">\(\dx{t}\)</span> is zero:</div>

<div class="para">As a practical matter we will rarely be interested in second order differentials like <span class="process-math">\(\dx^2x\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\dx^2y\text{.}\)</span> As we indicated in <a href="SECTIONHist-intr.html" class="internal" title="Section 4.1: Historical Introduction">Section 4.1</a> the notion of a differential is really just an aid to computation, a convenient fiction.

<div class="para">But now there is another difficulty that can’t be ignored.  In order to make sense of the expression <span class="process-math">\(\dx^2{x}\)</span> we had to abandon Leibniz’ conception altogether. It is nice that Newton’s viewpoint gives us a way to make sense of the notation but what this tells us is that taking either viewpoint (Newton’s or Leibniz’) does not get us to the logical heart of the matter. A viewpoint is just a manner of thinking.

When we are done, when we stand at the top of the Calculus mountain we will be able to see the paths that Newton and Leibniz each took to get to the top.
