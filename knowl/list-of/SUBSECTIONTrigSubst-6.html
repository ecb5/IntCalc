<div class="para">The idea of making substitutions like <span class="process-math">\(x=\tan(\theta ) \)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(x=\sin( \theta )\)</span> goes against everything we’ve ever said about substitution. We’ve always said that by substituting we were making things “easier on the eyes,” meaning of course that we were making things look simpler. But setting <span class="process-math">\(z=\tan( \theta )\)</span> to turn <span class="process-math">\(\int
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+z^2}}\dx{z}\)</span> into <span class="process-math">\(\int\frac{\sec^2(\theta )}
{\sqrt{1+\tan^2(\theta)}}\dx{\theta}\)</span> as we did in <a href="SECTIONSubstMethed.html#EQUATIONInvSubst1" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/EQUATIONInvSubst1.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Equation 19.16">equation (19.16)</a> hardly seems to be making anything simpler. If anything it looks more complicated.<div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#SUBSECTIONTrigSubst-6-3" title="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph" aria-label="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph">🔗</a></div>
</div>
<div class="para">But remember that our over–arching goal is always to solve the problem in front of us. If some substitution makes things “easier on the eyes” that’s nice, but the real question is “Does it help solve the problem?” A “simplification” that doesn’t help solve the problem is really a complication in a disguise. And a complication that allows you to (eventually) solve your problem is really a simplification in disguise. Don’t reject a simplification just because it seems to make things more complicated at first. Take it another step or two and see what happens.<div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#SUBSECTIONTrigSubst-6-4" title="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph" aria-label="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph">🔗</a></div>

<div class="para">This will sometimes feel as if you are wasting your time but you are not. Time spent thinking about your problem is always time well spent, even if it doesn’t yield immediate results. When solving any problem you always have to try something that don’t work (often several “somethings”) before you find something that does. That it is hard to do now is a testament to how far you’ve come. The easy problems are behind you.<div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#SUBSECTIONTrigSubst-6-5" title="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph" aria-label="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph">🔗</a></div>
