<div class="para">Actually, the idea of computing areas and volumes using infinitely thin slices predates the invention of differential calculus (by a lot!) and was influential in the invention and use of differential calculus.  The first known results were by Archimedes circa 250 BC.  This predates the first paper of differential calculus (1684 AD) by almost 200 years.  We wonâ€™t get into Archimedes method for doing this, but the immediate predecessors of Newton and Leibniz used the same idea of dividing objects into infinitely thin slices to determine areas and volumes.  They just didnâ€™t have the fundamental theorem of calculus to compute the value when these slices were added up (integrated), so they used alternate methods.<div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#EXAMPLETorricellisTrumpet-2" title="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph" aria-label="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph">ðŸ”—</a></div>

<div class="para">One of these predecessors was Evangelista Torricelli (1608â€“1647).  In 1643, Torricelli created a mathematical and philosophical stir with a paper he wrote in 1643 <i class="foreign">De solido hyperbolico acuto</i>.  In this paper, he had the following theorem (Translated by G. Loria and G. Vassura 1919).<div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#EXAMPLETorricellisTrumpet-4" title="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph" aria-label="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph">ðŸ”—</a></div>
